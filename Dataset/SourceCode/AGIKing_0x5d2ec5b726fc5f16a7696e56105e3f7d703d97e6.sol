Regal Edicts for the Initiation of Asset Sovereign Pickup



In a realm where the tangible and intangible entwine like ivy on the castle walls, procuring physical dominion over your Asset Sovereign Token becomes a majestic affair. Let this missive guide you through this splendiferous rite:



The Opening Fanfare



Direct an epistle to the contract’s sovereign via the Point of Contact, elegantly bejeweling it with the _tokenId that symbolizes your exquisite asset.



The Herald's Proclamation



Your claim shall be verified by the digital scribe utilizing ECDSA and keccak256 cryptographic alchemy, thereby authenticating your entitlement to the Asset Sovereign Token in question.



The Oracle’s Decree



Ensure that your asset bathes in the luminescent glow of 'Active' and 'Tradeable' states as delineated in the smart contract's arcane scrolls.



The Conjuring of the Scroll



The contract’s sovereign will fashion a contactHash of opulent elegance, weaving in variables such as the pickup date, time, and celestial instructions.



The Sovereign Seal



Inscribe your contactHash and _tokenId using the ECDSA cryptograph, sealing it like the secret chamber of your empire.



The Council of the Elders



Anticipate the contract sovereign to assemble additional runic inscriptions from the multiSigOwners, thus validating your ascension into their elite circle.



The Moonsong Ritual



Upon the rite's completion, your asset shall transcend to a 'Suspended' state, akin to a serenade under a midnight moon.



The Royal Fanfare



Rejoice! The ethereal bells shall ring as the event PickupInitiated is emitted, exclaiming your _tokenId and contactHash.



"In the quietus between ink and eternity, you have made your mark; you are not just a keeper of tokens, but a Sovereign of Assets" - AGIKing



P.S.



Please note, esteemed sovereign, the asset may only be collected at the physical sanctuary specified within the contract; shipping is as inconceivable as a pauper's feast at a royal banquet.



Disclaimers



AGIKing Asset Sovereign Tokens are not speculative assets nor do they yield future returns.



[ H O W  T O  I N I T I A T E  P H Y S I C A L  P I C K U P  O F  Y O U R  A G I K I N G  N F T ]



Initiate Pickup of Your AGIKing Asset Sovereign Token



Step 1: Contact the Contract Owner



Reach out to the contract owner using the Point of Contact details. Provide them with your Token ID to identify the asset you wish to pick up.



Step 2: Validate Ownership



The contract owner will confirm your ownership of the asset using the provided Token ID.



Step 3: Check Asset State and Tradeability



Ensure that your asset is both 'Active' and 'Tradeable' in the smart contract.



Step 4: Generate Contact Hash



The contract owner will create a hash that includes specific details such as pick-up date, time, and any special instructions. This will serve as your contactHash.



Step 5: Digital Signatures



Sign the contactHash and your Token ID using the ECDSA algorithm.



Step 6: Multi-Signature Confirmation



The contract owner will acquire additional signatures from the multiSigOwners to validate your request.



Step 7: Asset State Change



Upon successful verification of all signatures, your asset's state in the smart contract will change to 'Suspended'.



Step 8: Final Confirmation



The smart contract will emit a PickupInitiated event, confirming the initiation of the pickup process for your asset.



P.S.: Note that the asset can only be picked up at its specified physical location. Shipping or other forms of delivery are not available.
