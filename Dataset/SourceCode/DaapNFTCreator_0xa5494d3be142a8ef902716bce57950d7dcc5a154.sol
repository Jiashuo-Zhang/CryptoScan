/**

 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed

 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an

 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer

 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.

 *

 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be

 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in

 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.

 *

 * For example:

 *

 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]

 * ```

 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {

 *     function initialize() initializer public {

 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");

 *     }

 * }

 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {

 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {

 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");

 *     }

 * }

 * ```

 *

 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as

 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.

 *

 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure

 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.

 *

 * [CAUTION]

 * ====

 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.

 *

 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation

 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke

 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:

 *

 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]

 * ```

 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor

 * constructor() {

 *     _disableInitializers();

 * }

 * ```

 * members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some

 * applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see

 * {AccessControlEnumerable}.

 *

 * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed

 * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by

 * using `public constant` hash digests:

 *

 * ```

 * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256("MY_ROLE");

 * ```

 *

 * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a

 * function call, use {hasRole}:

 *

 * ```

 * function foo() public {

 *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));

 *     ...

 * }

 * ```

 *

 * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and

 * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only

 * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.

 *

 * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means

 * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other

 * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using

 * {_setRoleAdmin}.

 *

 * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to

 * grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure

 * accounts that have been granted it.
