MODULE DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------

A proxy contract that, if it does not recognise the function
being called on it, passes all value and call data to an
underlying target contract.

This proxy has the capacity to toggle between DELEGATECALL
and CALL style proxy functionality.

The former executes in the proxy's context, and so will preserve 
msg.sender and store data at the proxy address. The latter will not.
Therefore, any contract the proxy wraps in the CALL style must
implement the Proxyable interface, in order that it can pass msg.sender
into the underlying contract as the state parameter, messageSender.

The SNX supply schedule contract determines the amount of SNX tokens

Exponential Decay Inflation Schedule

Synthetix.mint() function is used to mint the inflationary supply.

The mechanics for Inflation Smoothing and Terminal Inflation 
have been defined in these sips
